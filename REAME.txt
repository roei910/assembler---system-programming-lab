the runfile will execute files in the order:

program >> run compiler for all input files ####good
compiler 
pre compiler >> create .am ###good
first run >> create symbol table, decode the program
second run >> continue decode program with symbol table
create files




need to create assembler file, the assembler will contain the IC and DC arrays, symbol table.
walk through all lines:
1. if the line is empty or comment, continue
2. command - check the command.
3. data - insert data to dc table. (insert label, base address, offset)
4. external - insert to external table*** check what to do.

every line is 20 bits, 
DC - from .string, .data
IC - from a command

first run - create sybol table (except for entry), add all lines to the decode table with values, except for data
second run - add entry tags to symbol table, finish decode for data
